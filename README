The Hershey fonts <http://www.ghostscript.com/doc/current/Hershey.htm>
are a set of fonts created by a Doctor A V Hershey in the 1960s. They
are stroke fonts, defined in terms of drawing lines, rather than
filling in curve outlines as with most scalable font formats. Thus,
they cannot easily be represented in a common font format like TrueType
or Type 1.

I created this HersheyPy project as a testbed for the user-fonts
functionality in Qahirah <https://github.com/ldo/qahirah>, my Python 3
wrapper for the Cairo graphics library, and these scripts require you
to have Qahirah installed. The enclosed “hershey_font.py” module provides
the basic functionality of loading a Hershey font and creating a
UserFontFace object from it that can be used to draw text into a
Context, while the “chart” and “render_text” scripts are examples
that make use of this module:

* “chart” generates a chart of all the characters defined by a Hershey font
* “render_text” renders a line of text in a Hershey font

There is some additional debug functionality in the code that was
put in to do a more thorough exercising of Qahirah, but which is not
needed for “production” use and so has been disabled. Feel free to
nosey around...

Note that I do not include the Hershey fonts themselves: on a Debian
system, the Hershey fonts come from the hershey-fonts-data package,
and can be found in the /usr/share/hershey-fonts directory when that
package is installed.
